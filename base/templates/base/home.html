                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        
                        API stands for Application Programming Interface. As the name suggests APIs act as an interface between software application ends to share resources with each other. Here the “Application” refers to a software application, and “Interface” refers to a point where the concerned software systems interact or meet.
                    </p>
                    <p>    
                        In today’s fast-changing Software programming landscape, it is extremely important that different software application ends easily share data with each other. For example, you may have your website/web application for your business. If such a need arises that you also need to build a mobile application for your business. In this case, the data needed by your mobile application will most likely be fetched from the website/web application already developed. 
                    </p>   
                    <p>     
                        For such needs, the mobile application developer will have to fetch the data by the use of APIs.
                        Yes, you read correctly it's the APIs that come in handy at this point in time. They are like the tunnel or transport medium that will do the logistics of data from one end-point to another. They work in terms of requests and responses. 
                    </p>
                    <p>    
                        The application requesting or sending a request is known as a Client while the one receiving the request and sending a response is known as a Server. So the data and resource exchange happens between a client and a server through the use of APIs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In short, APIs let you exchange resources like a delivery service and help connectivity between two software ends.
